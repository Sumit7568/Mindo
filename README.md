# Mindo
The mental health system provides a bot for emotional support in initial cases. For intermediate cases, PHQ-9/GAD-7 tools guide tasks, suggestions, and access to the "Mindo Community" with workshops, volunteering, and peer support. In emergencies, alerts notify family, healthcare centers, and experts for immediate professional help.
